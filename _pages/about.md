Short Bio
------
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), working with [Dr. Wenxiu Ma](https://faculty.ucr.edu/~wenxiu/) and [Dr. Vivian Wei Li](https://vivianli.org/#home). My research focuses on developing statistical and deep learning models for single-omics and genome-wide data analysis. I obtained my Ph.D. in Applied Statistics (2024) and an M.S. in Computer Science from UCR, following my B.S. in Actuarial Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Research Interest
------
* Computational Biology, bioinformatics
* Single-cell omics data analysis
* Deep learning-based and statistical algorithms in biological genomics data
